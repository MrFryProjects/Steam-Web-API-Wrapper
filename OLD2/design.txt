Overview:

Steam Web API (https://steamcommunity.com/dev) consists of four modules to pull data from various steam databases.
This data requires an API key and is accessed via GET/POST (https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview)
Data can be returned in json, xml, or vdf format

Goals:

To create a wrapper for the Steam Web API in Python.
Allow individual modules to be imported as-needed.
Allow iterative calling and batch-requests.

Modules:

handler.py
- Is responsible for functions used across all four API modules

ISteamNews.py
- Calls to news feeds for each Steam game

ISteamUserStats.py
- Calls to global stat information by game

ISteamUser.py
- Calls to provide information about Steam users

ITFItems_440.py
- Calls to provide player item data

Notes:

Much of the Steam Web API is restricted to registered developer partners and may not be implimented, including
above listed functionality when applicable.

VIA Steam (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#Interfaces_and_method)
All interfaces and method are self-documented through the ISteamWebAPIUtil/GetSupportedAPIList call. This can be found here.
When passed a key=<your API key> parameter, GetSupportedAPIList will show all APIs that your key can access. Without it (as above), it only displays APIs that do not require an API key.
